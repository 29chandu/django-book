=====================================
Chapter 4: The Django template system
=====================================

In the previous chapter, you may have noticed something peculiar in how we
returned the text in our example views. Namely, the HTML was hard-coded
directly in our Python code!

This arrangement leads to several problems:
     
    * Any change to the design of the page would require a change to
      the Python code. The design of a site tends to change far more frequently
      than the underlying Python code, so it would be convenient if the
      frequency of design changes were separated from changes to Python code.

    * Writing Python code and designing HTML are two different disciplines, and
      most professional Web development environments split these
      responsibilities across separate people (or even separate departments).
      Designers and HTML/CSS coders shouldn't have to edit Python code to get
      their job done; they should deal with HTML.

    * Similarly, it's most efficient if programmers can work on Python code and
      designers can work on templates at the same time, rather than one person
      waiting for the other to finish editing a single file that contains both
      Python and HTML.

For these reasons, it's much cleaner and more maintainable to separate the
design of the page from the Python code itself. We can do this with Django's
*template system*.

Template system basics
======================

A Django template is a string of text that is intended to separate the
presentation of a document from its data. A template defines placeholders and
various bits of basic logic -- *template tags* -- that regulate how the document
should be displayed. Usually, templates are used for producing HTML, but Django
templates are equally capable of generating any text-based format.

Let's dive in with a simple example template. This template describes an HTML
page that thanks a person for placing an order with a company. Think of it as a
form letter::

    <html>
    <head><title>Ordering notice</title></head>

    <body>

    <p>Dear {{ person_name }},</p>

    <p>Thanks for placing an order from {{ company }}. It's scheduled to
    ship on {{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y" }}.</p>

    <p>Here are the items you've ordered:</p>

    <ul>
    {% for item in item_list %}
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    {% if ordered_warranty %}
    <p>Your warranty information will be included in the packaging.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <p>Sincerely,<br />{{ company }}</p>

    </body>
    </html>

This template is basic HTML with some *variables* and *template tags*
thrown in. Let's step through it:

    * Any text surrounded by a pair of braces -- e.g., ``{{ person_name }}``
      -- is a *variable*. This means "insert the
      value of the variable with the given name." 
      
      How do we specify the values of the variables? We'll get to that in a
      moment.

    * Any text that's surrounded by curly braces and percent signs -- e.g., ``{%
      if ordered_warranty %}`` -- is a *template tag*. The definition of a tag
      is quite broad: A tag just tells the template system to "do something."

      This example template contains two tags -- the ``{% for item in item_list
      %}`` tag (a "for" tag) and the ``{% if ordered_warranty %}`` tag (an "if"
      tag).
      
      A "for" tag acts as a simple loop construct, letting you loop over each
      item in a sequence. An "if" tag, as you may expect, acts as a logical "if"
      statement. In this particular case, the tag checks whether the value of
      the ``ordered_warranty`` variable evaluates to ``True``. If it does, the
      template system will display everything between the ``{% if
      ordered_warranty %}`` and ``{% endif %}``. If not, the template system
      won't display it. The template system also supports ``{% else %}`` and
      other various logic statements.

    * Finally, the second paragraph of this template has an example of a
      *filter*. Filters are a way to alter the display of a variable. In this
      example -- ``{{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y" }}`` -- we're passing the
      ``ship_date`` variable to the ``date`` filter, giving the ``date`` filter
      an argument ``"F j, Y"``. The ``date`` filter formats dates in a given
      format, as specified by that argument. Filters are attached using a pipe
      character (``|``), as a reference to Unix pipes.

Each Django template has access to several built-in tags and filters, many of
which are discussed below. Appendix 6, "Built-in template tags and filters", has
the full list, and it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with that list so
you know what's possible. It's also possible to create your own filters and
tags, which we'll cover in Chapter 10.

Using the template system
=========================

To use the template system in Python code, just follow these two steps:

    * First, create a ``Template`` object by providing the raw template code as
      a string. Django also offers a way to create ``Template`` objects by
      designating the path to a template file on the filesystem; we'll see that
      in a bit.

    * Then, call the ``render()`` method of the ``Template`` object with a given
      set of variables -- the context. This returns a fully rendered template as
      a string, with all of the variables and block tags evaluated according to
      the context.

Creating template objects
-------------------------

The easiest way to create a ``Template`` object is to instantiate it directly.
The ``Template`` class lives in the ``django.template`` module, and the
constructor takes one argument, the raw template code. Let's dip into the Python
interactive interpreter to see how this works in code.

.. admonition:: Interactive interpreter examples

    Throughout this book, we'll feature example Python interactive interpreter
    sessions. You can recognize these examples by spotting the triple
    greater-than signs (``>>>``), which designate the interpreter's prompt. If
    you're copying examples from this book, don't copy those greater-than signs.

    Multiline statements in the interactive interpreter are padded with three
    dots (``...``). For example::

        >>> print """This is a
        ... string that spans
        ... three lines."""
        This is a
        string that spans
        three lines.
        >>> def my_function(value):
        ...     print value
        >>> my_function('hello')
        hello

    Those three dots at the start of the additional lines are inserted by the
    Python shell -- they're not part of our input. We include them here to be
    faithful to the actual output of the interpreter. If you copy our examples
    to follow along, don't copy those dots.

From within the project directory created by ``django-admin.py startproject``
(as covered in Chapter 2), type ``python manage.py shell`` to start the
interactive interpreter. Here's a basic walkthrough::

    >>> from django.template import Template
    >>> t = Template("My name is {{ name }}.")
    >>> print t

If you're following along interactively, you'll see something like this::

    <django.template.Template object at 0xb7d5f24c>

That ``0xb7d5f24c`` will be different every time, and it doesn't really matter;
it's simply the Python "identity" of the ``Template`` object.


.. admonition:: Django settings

    When using Django, you'll need to tell Django which settings to use.
    Interactively, this is typically done using ``python manage.py
    shell``, but addititional approaches are covered in Appendix 5,
    "Settings reference".

When you create a ``Template`` object, the template system compiles the raw
template code into an internal, optimized form, ready for rendering. But if your
template code includes any syntax errors, the call to ``Template()`` will cause
a ``TemplateSyntaxError`` exception::

    >>> from django.template import Template
    >>> t = Template('{% notatag %} ')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
      ...
      django.template.TemplateSyntaxError: Invalid block tag: 'notatag'

The system raises a ``TemplateSyntaxError`` exception for any of the following
cases:

    * Invalid block tags.
    * Invalid arguments to valid block tags.
    * Invalid filters.
    * Invalid arguments to valid filters.
    * Invalid template syntax.
    * Unclosed block tags (for block tags that require closing tags).

Rendering a template
--------------------

Once you have a ``Template`` object, you can pass it data by giving it a
*context*. A context is simply a set of variables and their associated
values. A template uses this to populate its variable tags and evaluate its
block tags.

A context is represented in Django by the ``Context`` class, which lives in the
``django.template`` module. Its constructor takes one optional argument: a
dictionary mapping variable names to variable values. Call the ``Template``
object's ``render()`` method with the context to "fill" the template. For
example::

    >>> from django.template import Context, Template
    >>> t = Template("My name is {{ name }}.")
    >>> c = Context({"name": "Stephane"})
    >>> t.render(c)
    'My name is Stephane.'

.. admonition:: Dictionaries and Contexts

   A Python ``dict`` is a mapping from known keys to variable
   values.  This is pretty similar to a ``Context``, but the ``Context``
   provides additional functionality covered in Chapter 10.

Variable names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) and may contain digits,
underscores and dots. (Dots are a special case we'll get to in a moment.)
Variable names are case sensitive.

Here's an example of template compilation and rendering, using the sample
template from the beginning of this chapter::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> raw_template = """<p>Dear {{ person_name }},</p>
    ...
    ... <p>Thanks for ordering {{ product }} from {{ company }}. It's scheduled to
    ... ship on {{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y" }}.</p>
    ...
    ... {% if ordered_warranty %}
    ... <p>Your warranty information will be included in the packaging.</p>
    ... {% endif %}
    ...
    ... <p>Sincerely,<br />{{ company }}</p>"""
    >>> t = Template(raw_template)
    >>> import datetime
    >>> c = Context({'person_name': 'John Smith',
    ...     'product': 'Super Lawn Mower',
    ...     'company': 'Outdoor Equipment',
    ...     'ship_date': datetime.date(2009, 4, 2),
    ...     'ordered_warranty': True})
    >>> t.render(c)
    "<p>Dear John Smith,</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for ordering Super Lawn Mower from Outdoor Equipment.
    It's scheduled to ship on April 2, 2009.</p>\n\n<p>Your warranty information will be included
    in the packaging.</p>\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,<br />Outdoor Equipment</p>"

Let's step through this one statement at a time:

    * First, we import the classes ``Template`` and ``Context``, which both
      live in the module ``django.template``.

    * Next, we save the raw text of our template into the variable
      ``raw_template``. Note that we use a triple quote marks to designate the
      string, because it wraps over multiple lines; strings designated with
      single quote marks cannot be wrapped over multiple lines.

    * Next, we create a template object ``t`` by passing ``raw_template`` to
      the ``Template`` class constructor.

    * Then we import the ``datetime`` module from Python's standard library,
      because we'll need it in the following statement.

    * Next, we create a ``Context` object ``c``. The ``Context``
      constructor takes a Python dictionary, which maps variable names to
      values. Here, for example, we specify that the ``person_name``
      is ``'John Smith'``, ``product`` is ``'Super Lawn Mower'``, etc.

    * Finally, we call the ``render()`` method on our template object, passing
      it the context. This returns the rendered template -- that is, it
      replaces template variables with the actual values of the variables, and
      it executes any block tags.

      Note that the warranty paragraph was displayed because the
      ``ordered_warranty`` variable evaluated to ``True``. Also note the
      date, ``April 2, 2009``, which is displayed according to the format
      string ``'F j, Y'``. (We'll explain format strings for the ``date``
      filter shortly.)

      If you're new to Python, you may wonder why this output includes
      newline characters (``'\n'``) rather than displaying the line breaks.
      That's happening because of a subtlety in the Python interactive
      interpreter: The call to ``t.render(c)`` returns a string, and by default
      the interactive interpreter displays the *representation* of the string,
      rather than the printed value of the string. If you want to see the
      string with line breaks displayed as true line breaks rather than ``'\n'``
      characters, use the ``print`` statement: ``print t.render(c)``.

Those are the fundamentals of using the Django template system -- just write a
template, create a ``Template`` object, create a ``Context`` and call
the ``render()`` method.

Multiple contexts, same template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have a ``Template`` object, you can render multiple contexts through it.
For example::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> t = Template('Hello, {{ name }}')
    >>> print t.render(Context({'name': 'John'}))
    Hello, John
    >>> print t.render(Context({'name': 'Julie'}))
    Hello, Julie
    >>> print t.render(Context({'name': 'Pat'}))
    Hello, Pat

Whenever you're using the same template source to render multiple
contexts like this, it's more efficient to create the ``Template``
object *once*, then call ``render()`` on it multiple times. For example::

    # Bad
    for name in ('John', 'Julie', 'Pat'):
        t = Template('Hello, {{ name }}')
        print t.render(Context({'name': name}))

    # Good
    t = Template('Hello, {{ name }}')
    for name in ('John', 'Julie', 'Pat'):
        print t.render(Context({'name': name}))

Django's template parsing is quite fast. Behind the scenes, most of the parsing
happens via a single call to a short regular expression. This is a stark
contrast to XML-based templating engines, which incur the overhead of an XML
parser and tend to be orders of magnitude slower than Django's template
rendering engine.

Context variable lookup
-----------------------

In the examples so far, we've passed simple values in the contexts --
mostly strings, plus a ``datetime.date`` example. However, the template system
elegantly handles more complex data structures, such as lists, dictionaries and
custom objects.

The key to traversing complex data structures in Django templates is the dot
(``.``) character. Use a dot to access dictionary keys, attributes, indices or
methods of an object.

This is best illustrated with a few examples. For instance, suppose
you're passing a Python dictionary to a template. To access the values
of that dictionary by dictionary key, use a dot::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> person = {'name': 'Sally', 'age': '43'}
    >>> t = Template('{{ person.name }} is {{ person.age }} years old.')
    >>> c = Context({'person': person})
    >>> t.render(c)
    'Sally is 43 years old.'

Similarly, dots also allow access of object attributes. For example, a Python
``datetime.date`` object has ``year``, ``month`` and ``day`` attributes, and
you can use a dot to access those attributes in a Django template::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> import datetime
    >>> d = datetime.date(1993, 5, 2)
    >>> d.year
    1993
    >>> d.month
    5
    >>> d.day
    2
    >>> t = Template('The month is {{ date.month }} and the year is {{ date.year }}.')
    >>> c = Context({'date': d})
    >>> t.render(c)
    'The month is 5 and the year is 1993.'

This example uses a custom class::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> class Person(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
    ...         self.first_name, self.last_name = first_name, last_name
    >>> t = Template('Hello, {{ person.first_name }} {{ person.last_name }}.')
    >>> c = Context({'person': Person('John', 'Smith')})
    >>> t.render(c)
    'Hello, John Smith.'

Dots are also used to call methods on objects. For example, each
Python string has the methods ``upper()`` and ``isdigit()``, and you can call
those in Django templates using the same dot syntax::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> t = Template('{{ var }} -- {{ var.upper }} -- {{ var.isdigit }}')
    >>> t.render(Context({'var': 'hello'}))
    'hello -- HELLO -- False'
    >>> t.render(Context({'var': '123'}))
    '123 -- 123 -- True'

Note that you don't include parentheses in the method calls. Also, it's not
possible to pass arguments to the methods; you can only call methods that have
no required arguments. (We'll explain this philosophy later in this chapter.)

Finally, dots are also used to access list indices. For example::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> t = Template('Item 2 is {{ items.2 }}.')
    >>> c = Context({'items': ['apples', 'bananas', 'carrots']})
    >>> t.render(c)
    'Item 2 is carrots.'

Negative list indices are not allowed. For example, the template variable
``{{ items.-1 }}`` would cause a ``TemplateSyntaxError``.

.. admonition:: Python lists

   Python lists have 0-based indices so that the first item is at
   index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on.
   
The dot lookups can be summarized like this: When the template system
encounters a dot in a variable name, it tries the following lookups, in this
order:

    * Dictionary lookup. Example: ``foo["bar"]``
    * Attribute lookup. Example: ``foo.bar``
    * Method call. Example: ``foo.bar()``
    * List-index lookup. Example: ``foo[bar]``

The system uses the first lookup type that works. It's short-circuit logic.

Dot lookups can be nested multiple levels deep. For instance, the following
example uses ``{{ person.name.upper }}``, which translates into a dictionary
lookup (``person['name']``), then a method call (``upper()``)::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> person = {'name': 'Sally', 'age': '43'}
    >>> t = Template('{{ person.name.upper }} is {{ person.age }} years old.')
    >>> c = Context({'person': person})
    >>> t.render(c)
    'SALLY is 43 years old.'

Method call behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Method calls are slightly more complex than the other lookup types. Here are
some things to keep in mind:

    * If, during the method lookup, a method raises an exception, the exception
      will be propagated, unless the exception has an attribute
      ``silent_variable_failure`` whose value is ``True``. If the exception
      *does* have a ``silent_variable_failure`` attribute, the variable will
      render as an empty string. For example::

        >>> t = Template("My name is {{ person.first_name }}.")
        >>> class PersonClass3:
        ...     def first_name(self):
        ...         raise AssertionError, "foo"
        >>> p = PersonClass3()
        >>> t.render(Context({"person": p}))
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: foo

        >>> class SilentAssertionError(AssertionError):
        ...     silent_variable_failure = True
        >>> class PersonClass4:
        ...     def first_name(self):
        ...         raise SilentAssertionError
        >>> p = PersonClass4()
        >>> t.render(Context({"person": p}))
        "My name is ."

    * A method call will only work if the method has no required arguments.
      Otherwise, the system will move to the next lookup type (list-index
      lookup).

    * Obviously, some methods have side effects, and it'd be foolish at best,
      and possibly even a security hole, to allow the template system to access
      them.

      Say, for instance, you have a ``BankAccount`` object that has a
      ``delete()`` method. The template system shouldn't be allowed to do
      something like this::

        I will now delete this valuable data. {{ account.delete }}

      To prevent this, set a function attribute ``alters_data`` on the method.
      The template system won't execute a method if the method has
      ``alters_data=True`` set. For example::

          def delete(self):
              # Delete the account
          delete.alters_data = True

How invalid variables are handled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, if a variable doesn't exist, the template system renders it as an
empty string, failing silently. For example::

    >>> from django.template import Template, Context
    >>> t = Template('Your name is {{ name }}.')
    >>> t.render(Context())
    'Your name is .'
    >>> t.render(Context({'var': 'hello'}))
    'Your name is .'
    >>> t.render(Context({'NAME': 'hello'}))
    'Your name is .'
    >>> t.render(Context({'Name': 'hello'}))
    'Your name is .'

The system fails silently rather than raising an exception because it's
intended to be resilient to human error. In this case, all of the
lookups failed because variable names have the wrong case or name.  In the real
world, it's unacceptable for a Web site to become inaccessible due to a
small template syntax error.

Note that it's possible to change Django's default behavior in this regard, by
tweaking a setting in your Django configuration. We'll discuss this in Chapter
10, "Extending the template engine."

Playing with Context objects
----------------------------

Most of the time, you'll instantiate ``Context`` objects by passing in a
fully-populated dictionary to ``Context()``. But you can add and delete items
from a ``Context`` object once it's been instantiated, too, using standard
Python dictionary syntax::

    >>> from django.template import Context
    >>> c = Context({"foo": "bar"})
    >>> c['foo']
    'bar'
    >>> del c['foo']
    >>> c['foo']
    ''
    >>> c['newvariable'] = 'hello'
    >>> c['newvariable']
    'hello'

Basic template tags and filters
===============================

As we've mentioned already, the template system ships with built-in tags and
filters. Here's a rundown of the most common ones. 

if/else
-------

The ``{% if %}`` tag evaluates a variable, and if that variable is "true"
(i.e. it exists, is not empty, and is not a false boolean value), the system
will display everything between ``{% if %}`` and ``{% endif %}``. For example::

    {% if today_is_weekend %}
        <p>Welcome to the weekend!</p>
    {% endif %}

An ``{% else %}`` tag is optional::

    {% if today_is_weekend %}
        <p>Welcome to the weekend!</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Get back to work.</p>
    {% endif %}

.. admonition:: Python truthiness

   In Python, the empty list (``[]``), tuple (``()``), dictionary
   (``{}``), string (``''``), zero (``0``), and the special object ``None`` are
   False in a boolean context.  Everything else is True.

The ``{% if %}`` tag accepts ``and``, ``or`` or ``not`` for testing multiple
variables, or to negate a given variable. For example::

    {% if athlete_list and coach_list %}
        Both athletes and coaches are available.
    {% endif %}

    {% if not athlete_list %}
        There are no athletes.
    {% endif %}

    {% if athlete_list or coach_list %}
        There are some athletes or some coaches.
    {% endif %}

    {% if not athlete_list or coach_list %}
        There are no athletes or there are some coaches (OK, so
        writing English translations of boolean logic sounds
        stupid; it's not our fault).
    {% endif %}

    {% if athlete_list and not coach_list %}
        There are some athletes and absolutely no coaches.
    {% endif %}

``{% if %}`` tags don't allow ``and`` and ``or`` clauses within the same tag,
because the order of logic would be ambiguous. For example, this is invalid::

    {% if athlete_list and coach_list or cheerleader_list %}

Parentheses for controlling order of operations are not allowed.  If
you find yourself needing them, consider performing that logic in the
view code in order to simplify the templates.  Even so, if you need to combine
``and`` and ``or`` to do advanced logic, just use nested ``{% if %}``
tags.  For example::

    {% if athlete_list %}
        {% if coach_list or cheerleader_list %}
            We have athletes, and either coaches or cheerleaders!
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

Multiple uses of the same logical operator are fine, but you can not
combine different operators. For example, this is valid::

    {% if athlete_list or coach_list or parent_list or teacher_list %}

There is no ``{% elif %}`` tag. Use nested ``{% if %}`` tags to accomplish
the same thing::

    {% if athlete_list %}
        <p>Here are the athletes: {{ athlete_list }}.</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>No athletes are available.</p>
        {% if coach_list %}
            <p>Here are the coaches: {{ coach_list }}.</p>
        {% endif %}
    {% endif %}

Make sure to close each ``{% if %}`` with an ``{% endif %}``. Otherwise, Django
will throw a ``TemplateSyntaxError``.

for
---

The ``{% for %}`` tag allows you to loop over each item in a sequence. As in
Python's ``for`` statement, the syntax is ``for X in Y``, where ``Y`` is the
sequence to loop over and ``X`` is the name of the variable to use for a
particular cycle of the loop. Each time through the loop, the template system
will render everything between ``{% for %}`` and ``{% endfor %}``.

For example, to display a list of athletes given a variable ``athlete_list``::

    <ul>
    {% for athlete in athlete_list %}
        <li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

Add ``reversed`` to the tag to loop over the list in reverse::

    {% for athlete in athlete_list reversed %}
    ...
    {% endfor %}

It's possible to nest ``{% for %}`` tags::

    {% for country in countries %}
        <h1>{{ country.name }}</h1>
        <ul>
        {% for city in country.city_list %}
            <li>{{ city }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endfor %}

There is no support for "breaking" out of a loop before the loop is finished.
If you want to accomplish this, change the variable you're looping over so that
it only includes the values you want to loop over. Similarly, there is no
support for a "continue" statement that would instruct the loop processor to
return immediately to the front of the loop. (See "Philosophies and limitations"
later in this chapter for the reasoning behind this design decision.)

The ``{% for %}`` tag sets a magic ``forloop`` template variable within the
loop. This variable has a few attributes that give you information about the
progress of the loop:

    * ``forloop.counter`` is always set to an integer representing the number
      of times the loop has been entered. This is one-indexed, so the first
      time through the loop, ``forloop.counter`` will be set to ``1``.
      Example::

          {% for item in todo_list %}
              <p>{{ forloop.counter }}: {{ item }}</p>
          {% endfor %}

    * ``forloop.counter0`` is like ``forloop.counter``, except it's
      zero-indexed. Its value will be set to ``0`` the first time through the
      loop.

    * ``forloop.revcounter`` is always set to an integer representing the
      number of remaining items in the loop. The first time through the loop,
      ``forloop.revcounter`` will be set to the total number of items in the
      sequence you're traversing. The last time through the loop,
      ``forloop.revcounter`` will be set to ``1``.

    * ``forloop.revcounter0`` is like ``forloop.revcounter``, except it's
      zero-indexed. The first time through the loop, ``forloop.revcounter0``
      will be set to the number of elements in the sequence minus one. The last
      time through the loop, it will be set to ``0``.

    * ``forloop.first`` is a boolean value set to ``True`` if this is the first
      time through the loop. This is convenient for special-casing::

          {% for object in objects %}
              {% if forloop.first %}<li class="first">{% else %}<li>{% endif %}
              {{ object }}
              </li>
          {% endfor %}

    * ``forloop.last`` is a boolean value set to ``True`` if this is the last
      time through the loop. An example use for this would be to put pipe
      characters between a list of links::

          {% for link in links %}{{ link }}{% if not forloop.last %} | {% endif %}{% endfor %}

    * ``forloop.parentloop`` is a reference to the ``forloop`` object for the
      *parent* loop, in case of nested loops. For example::

          {% for country in countries %}
              <table>
              {% for city in country.city_list %}
                  <tr>
                  <td>Country #{{ forloop.parentloop.counter }}</td>
                  <td>City #{{ forloop.counter }}</td>
                  <td>{{ city }}</td>
                  </tr>
              {% endfor %}
              </table>
          {% endfor %}

The magic ``forloop`` variable is only available within loops. After the
template parser has reached ``{% endfor %}``, ``forloop`` disappears.


.. admonition:: Context and the forloop variable

   Inside the ``{% for %}`` block, the existing variables are moved
   out of the way to avoid overwriting them  magic ``forloop``
   variable.  Django exposes this moved context in
   ``forloop.parentloop``.  You generally don't need to worry about
   this, but if you supply a template variable named ``forloop``
   (though we advise against it), it'll be named
   ``forloop.parentloop`` while inside the ``{% for %}`` block.

ifequal/ifnotequal
------------------

The Django template system deliberately is not a full-fledged programming
language and, thus, does not allow you to execute arbitrary Python statements.
(More on this in "Philosophies and limitations" below.) However, it's quite
a common template requirement to compare two values and display something if
they're equal -- and Django provides an ``{% ifequal %}`` tag for that purpose.

The ``{% ifequal %}`` tag compares two values and displays everything between
``{% ifequal %}`` and ``{% endifequal %}`` if the values are equal.

This example compares the template variables ``user`` and ``currentuser``::

    {% ifequal user currentuser %}
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    {% endifequal %}

The arguments can be hard-coded strings, with either single or double quotes,
so the following is valid::

    {% ifequal section 'sitenews' %}
        <h1>Site News</h1>
    {% endifequal %}

    {% ifequal section "community" %}
        <h1>Community</h1>
    {% endifequal %}

Just like ``{% if %}``, the ``{% ifequal %}`` tag supports an optional
``{% else %}``::

    {% ifequal section 'sitenews' %}
        <h1>Site News</h1>
    {% else %}
        <h1>No News Here</h1>
    {% endifequal %}

Only template variables, strings, integers and decimal numbers are allowed as
arguments to ``{% ifequal %}``. These are valid examples::

    {% ifequal variable 1 %}
    {% ifequal variable 1.23 %}
    {% ifequal variable 'foo' %}
    {% ifequal variable "foo" %}

Any other types of variables, such as Python dictionaries, lists or booleans,
can not be hard-coded in ``{% ifequal %}``. These are invalid examples::

    {% ifequal variable True %}
    {% ifequal variable [1, 2, 3] %}
    {% ifequal variable {'key': 'value'} %}

If you need to test whether something is true or false, use the ``{% if %}``
tags instead of ``{% ifequal %}``.

Comments
--------

Just as in HTML or in a programming language such as Python, the Django
template language allows for comments. To designate a comment, use ``{# #}``.
For example::

    {# This is a comment #}

Comment will not be output when the template is rendered.

A comment cannot span multiple lines. This limitation improves template
parsing performaance. In the following template, the rendered output
will look exactly the same as the template (i.e., the comment tag will
not be parsed as a comment)::

    This is a {# this is not
    a comment #}
    test.

Filters
-------

As explained earlier in this chapter, template filters are simple ways of
altering the value of variables before they're displayed.

Filters look like this::

    {{ name|lower }}

This displays the value of the ``{{ name }}`` variable after being filtered
through the ``lower`` filter, which converts text to lowercase. Use a pipe
(``|``) to apply a filter.

Filters can be chained -- that is, the output of one filter is applied to the
next. Here's a common idiom for escaping text contents, then converting line
breaks to ``<p>`` tags::

    {{ my_text|escape|linebreaks }}

Some filters take arguments. A filter argument looks like this::

    {{ bio|truncatewords:"30" }}


This displays the first 30 words of the ``bio`` variable. Filter arguments
are always in double quotes.

Here are a few of the most important filters; Appendix 6 covers the rest:

    * ``addslashes`` -- Adds a backslash before any backslash, single quote or
      double quote. This is useful if the produced text is included in
      a JavaScript string.

    * ``date`` -- Formats a ``date`` or ``datetime`` object according to a
      format string given in the parameter. For example::

          {{ pub_date|date:"F j, Y" }}

      Format strings are defined in Appendix 6.

    * ``escape`` -- Escapes ampersands, quotes and angle brackets in the given
      string. This is useful for sanitizing user-submitted data and for
      ensuring data is valid XML or XHTML. Specifically, ``escape`` makes these
      conversions:

          * Converts ``&`` to ``&amp;``
          * Converts ``<`` to ``&lt;``
          * Converts ``>`` to ``&gt;``
          * Converts ``"`` (double quote) to ``&quot;``
          * Converts ``'`` (single quote) to ``&#39;``

    * ``length`` -- Returns the length of the value. You can use this on a list
      or a string, or any Python object that knows how to determine its length
      (i.e., any object that has a ``__len__()`` method).

Philosophies and limitations
============================

Now that you've gotten a feel for the Django template language, we should point
out some of its intentional limitations, along with some philosophies on why it
works the way it works.

More than any other component of Web applications, programmer opinions on
template systems vary wildly.  The fact that Python alone has dozens,
if not hundreds, of open-source template-language
implementations, supports this point.  Each was likely created because
its developer deemed all existing template languages inadequate. (In
fact, it is said to be a rite of passage for a Python developer to
write his or her own template language! And if you haven't done this
yet, consider it. It's a fun exercise.)

With that in mind, you might be interested to know that Django
doesn't require that you use its template language. Because Django is intended
to be a full-stack Web framework that provides all the pieces necessary to be a
productive Web developer, many times it's *more convenient* to use Django's
template system than other Python template libraries, but it's not a strict
requirement in any sense. As we'll see in the section "Using templates in views"
below, it's very easy to use another template language with Django -- almost
as easy as using Django's template language.

Still, it's clear we have a strong preference for the way Django's template
language works. The template system has roots in how Web development is done at
World Online and the combined experience of Django's creators. Here are a few
of those philosophies:

    * **Business logic should be separated from presentation logic.** 
    
      We see a template system as a tool that controls presentation and
      presentation-related logic -- and that's it. The template system shouldn't
      support functionality that goes beyond this basic goal.

      For that reason, it's impossible to call Python code directly within
      Django templates. All "programming" is fundamentally limited to the scope
      of what template tags can do. It *is* possible to write custom template
      tags that do arbitrary things, but the out-of-the-box Django template
      tags intentionally do not allow for arbitrary Python code execution.

    * **Syntax should be decoupled from HTML/XML.** 
    
      Although Django's template system is used primarily to produce HTML, it's
      intended to be just as usable for non-HTML formats, such as plain text.
      Some other template languages are XML-based, placing all template logic
      within XML tags or attributes, but Django deliberately avoids this
      limitation. Requiring valid XML to write templates introduces a world of
      human mistakes and hard-to-understand error messages, and using an XML
      engine to parse templates incurs an unacceptable level of overhead in
      template processing.

    * **Designers are assumed to be comfortable with HTML code.** 
    
      The template system isn't designed so that templates necessarily are
      displayed nicely in WYSIWYG editors such as Dreamweaver. That is too
      severe a limitation and wouldn't allow the syntax to be as nice as it is.
      Django expects template authors to be comfortable editing HTML directly.

    * **Designers are assumed not to be Python programmers.** 
    
      The template system authors recognize that Web page templates are most
      often written by *designers*, not *programmers*, and therefore should not
      assume Python knowledge.

      However, the system also intends to accomodate small teams in which the
      templates *are* created by Python programmers. It offers a way to extend
      the system's syntax by writing raw Python code. (More on this in Chapter
      10.)

    * **The goal is not to invent a programming language.** 
    
      The goal is to offer just enough programming-esque functionality, such as
      branching and looping, that is essential for making presentation-related
      decisions.

As a result of these design philosophies, the Django template language has
the following limitations:

    * **A template cannot set a variable or change the value of a variable.**
      
      It's possible to write custom template tags that accomplish these goals
      (see Chapter 10), but the stock Django template tags do not allow it.

    * **A template cannot call raw Python code.** 
    
      There's no way to "drop into Python mode" or use raw Python constructs.
      Again, it's possible to write custom template tags to do this, but the
      stock Django template tags don't allow it.

Using templates in views
========================

We've learned the basics of using the template system; now, let's integrate
this into a view. Recall the ``current_datetime`` view in
``mysite.views``, started in the previous chapter. Here's what it looked like::

    from django.http import HttpResponse
    import datetime

    def current_datetime(request):
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        html = "<html><body>It is now %s.</body></html>" % now
        return HttpResponse(html)

Let's change this view to use Django's template system. At first, you might
think to do something like this::

    from django.template import Template, Context
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    import datetime

    def current_datetime(request):
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        t = Template("<html><body>It is now {{ current_date }}.</body></html>")
        html = t.render(Context({'current_date': now}))
        return HttpResponse(html)

Sure, that uses the template system, but it doesn't solve the problems we
pointed out in the introduction of this chapter. Namely, the template is still
embedded in the Python code. Let's fix that by putting the template in a
*separate file*, which this view will load.

You might first consider saving your template somewhere on your
filesystem and use Python's built-in file-opening functionality to read
the contents of the template. Here's what that might look like, assuming the
template was saved as the file ``/home/djangouser/templates/mytemplate.html``::

    from django.template import Template, Context
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    import datetime

    def current_datetime(request):
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        # Simple way of using templates from the filesystem.
        # This doesn't account for missing files!
        fp = open('/home/djangouser/templates/mytemplate.html')
        t = Template(fp.read())
        fp.close()
        html = t.render(Context({'current_date': now}))
        return HttpResponse(html)

This approach, however, is inelegant for these reasons:

    * It doesn't handle the case of a missing file. If the file
      ``mytemplate.html`` doesn't exist or isn't readable, the ``open()`` call
      would raise an ``IOError`` exception.

    * It hard-codes your template location. If you were to use this
      technique for every view function, you'd be duplicating the template
      locations. Not to mention that's a lot of typing!

    * It includes a lot of boring boilerplate code. The calls to
      ``open()``, ``fp.read()`` and ``fp.close()`` require a lot of
      work, and you have better things to do.

To solve these issues, we'll use *template loading* and *template directories*.

Template loading
================

Django provides a convenient and powerful API for loading templates from disk,
with the goal of removing redundancy both in your template-loading calls and in
your templates themselves.

In order to use this template-loading API, first you'll need to tell the
framework where you store your templates. The place to do this is in your
*settings file*.

A Django settings file is the place to put configuration for your Django
instance (aka your Django project). It's a simple Python module with
module-level variables, one for each setting.

When you ran ``django-admin.py startproject mysite`` in Chapter 2, the script
created a default settings file for you, aptly named ``settings.py``. Have a
look at the file's contents. It contains variables that look like this (though
not necessarily in this order)::

    DEBUG = True
    TIME_ZONE = 'America/Chicago'
    USE_I18N = True
    ROOT_URLCONF = 'mysite.urls'

This is pretty self-explanatory; the settings and their respective values are
simple Python variables. And because the settings file is just a plain Python
module, you can do dynamic things such as checking the value of one variable
before setting another. (This also means that you should avoid Python syntax
errors in your settings file.)

We'll cover settings files in depth in Appendix 5, but for now, have a
look at the ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` setting. This setting tells Django's template
loading mechanism where to look for templates. By default, it's an empty tuple.
Pick a directory where you'd like to store your templates, and add it to
``TEMPLATE_DIRS``, like so::

    TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
        '/home/django/mysite/templates',
    )

A few things to note:

    * You can specify any directory you want, as long as the directory and
      templates within that directory are readable by the user account under
      which your Web server runs. If you can't think of an appropriate
      place to put your templates, we recommend creating a
      ``templates`` directory within your Django project (i.e., within
      the ``mysite`` directory you created in Chapter 2, if you've
      been following along with our examples).

    * Don't forget the comma at the end of the template-directory string!
      Python requires commas within single-element tuples to disambiguate the
      tuple from a parenthetical expression. This is a common newbie gotcha.

      If you want to avoid this error, you can make ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` a list
      instead of a tuple, because single-element lists don't require a trailing
      comma::

          TEMPLATE_DIRS = [
              '/home/django/mysite/templates'
          ]

      A tuple is slightly more semantically-correct than a list (tuples cannot
      be changed after being created, and nothing should be changing settings
      once they've been read), so we recommend using a tuple for your
      ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` setting.

    * It's simplest to use absolute paths, i.e. directory paths that start at
      the root of the filesystem. If you want to be a bit more flexible and
      decoupled, though, you can take advantage of the fact that Django
      settings files are just Python code by constructing the contents of
      ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` dynamically. For example::

          import os.path

          TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
              os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'templates'),
          )

      This example uses the "magic" Python variable ``__file__``, which is
      automatically set to the filename of the Python module in which the code
      lives.

    * If you're on Windows, include your drive letter and use Unix-style
      forward slashes rather than backslashes. For example::

          TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
              'C:/www/django/templates',
          )

With ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` set, the next step is to change the view code to
use Django's template-loading functionality rather than hard-coding the
template paths. Returning to our ``current_datetime`` view, let's change it
like so::

    from django.template.loader import get_template
    from django.template import Context
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    import datetime

    def current_datetime(request):
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        t = get_template('current_datetime.html')
        html = t.render(Context({'current_date': now}))
        return HttpResponse(html)

In this example, we're using the function ``django.template.loader.get_template()``
rather than loading the template from the filesystem manually. The
``get_template()`` function takes a template name as its argument, figures out
where the template lives on the filesystem, opens that file and returns a
compiled ``Template`` object.

If ``get_template()`` cannot find the template with the given name, it raises
a ``TemplateDoesNotExist`` exception. To see what that looks like, fire up the
Django development server again, as in Chapter 3, by running
``python manage.py runserver`` within your Django project's directory. Then,
point your browser at the page that activates the ``current_datetime`` view
(e.g., ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/time/``). Assuming your ``DEBUG`` setting is set
to ``True`` and you haven't yet created a ``current_datetime.html`` template,
you should see a Django error page highlighting the ``TemplateDoesNotExist``
error.

(We'll have a screenshot here.)

This error page is similar to the one we explained in Chapter 3, with one
additional piece of debugging information: a "Template-loader postmortem"
section. This section tells you which templates Django tried to load, along
with the reason each attempt failed (e.g., "File does not exist"). This
information is invaluable when you're trying to debug template-loading errors.

As you can probably tell from the error messages foudn in the
screenshot above, Django attempted to find the template by combining
the directory in your ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` setting with the template name
you passed to ``get_template()``. So if your ``TEMPLATE_DIRS``
contains ``'/home/django/templates'``, Django looks for the file
``'/home/django/templates/current_datetime.html'``.  If
``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` contains more than one directory, each is checked
until the template is found or the they've all been checked.

Moving along, create the ``current_datetime.html`` file within your template
directory, using the following template code::

    <html><body>It is now {{ current_date }}.</body></html>

Refresh the page in your Web browser, and you should see the fully rendered
page.

render_to_response()
--------------------

Because it's such a common idiom to load a template, fill a ``Context`` and
return an ``HttpResponse`` object with the result of the rendered template,
Django provides a shortcut that lets you do those things in one line of code.
This shortcut is a function called ``render_to_response()``, which lives in the
module ``django.shortcuts``. Most of the time, you'll be using
``render_to_response()`` rather than loading templates and creating ``Context``
and ``HttpResponse`` objects manually.

Here's the ongoing ``current_datetime`` example rewritten to use
``render_to_response()``::

    from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
    import datetime

    def current_datetime(request):
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        return render_to_response('current_datetime.html', {'current_date': now})

What a difference! Let's step through the code changes:

    * We no longer have to import ``get_template``, ``Template``, ``Context``
      or ``HttpResponse``. Instead, we import
      ``django.shortcuts.render_to_response``. The ``import datetime`` remains.

    * Within the ``current_datetime`` function, we still calculate ``now``, but
      the template loading, context creation, template rendering and
      ``HttpResponse`` creation is all taken care of by the
      ``render_to_response()`` call. Because ``render_to_response()`` returns
      an ``HttpResponse`` object, we can simply ``return`` that value in the
      view.

The first argument to ``render_to_response()`` should be the name of the
template to use. The second argument, if given, should be a dictionary
to use in creating a ``Context`` for that template. If you don't
provide a second argument, ``render_to_response()`` will use an empty dictionary.

The locals() trick
------------------

Consider our latest incarnation of ``current_datetime``::

    def current_datetime(request):
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        return render_to_response('current_datetime.html', {'current_date': now})

Many times, as in this example, you'll find yourself calculating some values,
storing them in variables (e.g., ``now`` above) and sending those variables to
the template. Particularly lazy programmers would note that it's slightly
redundant to have to give names for temporary variables *and* give names for
the template variables. Not only is it redundant; it's extra typing.

So if you're one of those lazy programmers and you like keeping code
particularly concise, you can take advantage of a built-in Python function
called ``locals()``. It returns a dictionary mapping all local
variable names to their values. Thus, the above view could be
rewritten like so::

    def current_datetime(request):
        current_date = datetime.datetime.now()
        return render_to_response('current_datetime.html', locals())

Here, instead of manually specifying the context dictionary as before, we
instead pass the value of ``locals()``, which will include all variables
defined at that point in the function's execution. As a consequence, we've
renamed the ``now`` variable to ``current_date``, because that's the variable
name that the template expects. In this example, ``locals()`` doesn't offer a
*huge* improvement, but this technique can save you some typing if you've got
several template variables to define -- or if you're lazy.

One thing to watch out for when using ``locals()`` is that it includes *every*
local variable, which may comprise more variables than you actually want your
template to have access to. In the above example, ``locals()`` will also
include ``request``. Whether this matters to you depends on your application.

A final thing to consider is that ``locals()`` incurs a small bit of overhead,
because when you call it, Python has to create the dictionary dynamically. If
you specify the context dictionary manually, you avoid this overhead.

Subdirectories in get_template()
--------------------------------

It can get unwieldy to store all of your templates in a single directory. You
might like to store templates in subdirectories of your template directory, and
that's fine. In fact, we'd recommend it; some more advanced Django
features (such as the generic views system, which we'll cover in
Chapter 9) expect this template layout as a default convention.

Accomplishing that is easy. In your calls to ``get_template()``, just include
the subdirectory name and a slash before the template name, like so::

    t = get_template('dateapp/current_datetime.html')

Because ``render_to_response()`` is a small wrapper around ``get_template()``,
you can do the same thing with the first argument to ``render_to_response()``.

There's no limit to the depth of your subdirectory tree. Feel free to use
as many as you like.

Windows users, note: Make sure to use forward slashes rather than backslashes.
``get_template()`` assumes a Unix-style filename designation.

The include template tag
------------------------

Now that we've covered the template loading mechanism, we can introduce a
built-in template tag that takes advantage of it: ``{% include %}``. This tag
allows you to include the contents of another template. The argument to the tag
should be the name of the template to include, and the template name can be
either a variable or a hard-coded (quoted) string, in either single or double
quotes.  Any time you have the same code in multiple templates,
consider using an ``{% include %}`` to remove the duplication.

These two examples include the contents of the template ``nav.html``. The
examples are equivalent and illustrate that either single or double quotes
are allowed::

    {% include 'nav.html' %}
    {% include "nav.html" %}

This example includes the contents of the template ``includes/nav.html``::

    {% include 'includes/nav.html' %}

This example includes the contents of the template whose name is contained in
the variable ``template_name``::

    {% include template_name %}

As in ``get_template()``, the filename of the template is determined by adding
the template directory from ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` to the requested template name.

Included templates are evaluated with the context of the template
that's including it.

If a template with the given name isn't found, Django will do one of two
things:

    * If your ``DEBUG`` setting is set to ``True``, you'll see the
      ``TemplateDoesNotExist`` exception on a Django error page.

    * If your ``DEBUG`` setting is set to ``False``, the tag will fail
      silently, displaying nothing in the place of the tag.

Template inheritance
====================

Our template examples so far have been tiny HTML snippets, but in the real
world, you'll be using Django's template system to create entire HTML pages.
This leads to a common Web development problem: Across a Web site, how does
one reduce the duplication and redundancy of common page areas, such as
sitewide navigation?

A classic way of solving this problem is to use server-side includes,
directives you can embed within your HTML pages to "include" one Web page
inside another. Indeed, Django supports that approach, with the
``{% include %}`` template tag just described. But the preferred way of
solving this problem with Django is to use a more elegant strategy called
**template inheritance**.

In essence, template inheritance lets you build a base "skeleton" template that
contains all the common parts of your site and defines "blocks" that child
templates can override.

Let's see an example of this by creating a more complete template for our
``current_datetime`` view, by editing the ``current_datetime.html`` file::

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>The current time</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My helpful timestamp site</h1>
        <p>It is now {{ current_date }}.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

That looks just fine, but what happens when we want to create a template for
another view -- say, the ``hours_ahead`` view from Chapter 3? If we want again
to make a nice, valid, full HTML template, we'd create something like::

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Future time</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My helpful timestamp site</h1>
        <p>In {{ hour_offset }} hour(s), it will be {{ next_time }}.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

Clearly, we've just duplicated a lot of HTML. Imagine we had a more
typical site, including a navigation bar, a few stylesheets, perhaps some
JavaScript... We'd end up putting all sorts of redundant HTML into each
template.

The server-side include solution to this problem would be to factor out the
common bits in both templates and save them in separate template snippets,
which would then be included in each template. Perhaps you'd store the top
bit of the template in a file called ``header.html``::

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
    <html lang="en">
    <head>

And perhaps you'd store the bottom bit in a file called ``footer.html``::

        <hr>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

With an include-based strategy, headers and footers are easy. But it's the
middle ground that's messy. In this example, both pages feature a title --
``<h1>My helpful timestamp site</h1>`` -- but that title can't fit into
``header.html`` because the ``<title>`` on both pages is different. If we
included the ``<h1>`` in the header, we'd have to include the ``<title>``,
which wouldn't allow us to customize it per page. See where this is going?

Django's template inheritance system solves these problems. You can think of it
as an "inside out" version of server-side includes. Instead of defining the
snippets that are *common*, you define the snippets that are *different*.

The first step is to define a **base template** -- a skeleton of your page that
**child templates** will later fill in. Here's a base template for our ongoing
example::

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My helpful timestamp site</h1>
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        {% block footer %}
        <hr>
        <p>Thanks for visiting my site.</p>
        {% endblock %}
    </body>
    </html>

This template, which we'll call ``base.html``, defines a simple HTML skeleton
document that we'll use for all the pages on the site. It's the job of child
templates to override, or add to, or leave alone the contents of the blocks.
(If you're following along at home, save this file to your template directory.)

We're using a template tag here that you haven't seen before -- the
``{% block %}`` tag. All the ``{% block %}`` tags do is to tell the template
engine that a child template may override those portions of the template.

Now that we've got this base template, we can modify our existing
``current_datetime.html`` template to use it::

    {% extends "base.html" %}

    {% block title %}The current time{% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
    <p>It is now {{ current_date }}.</p>
    {% endblock %}

While we're at it, let's create a template for the ``hours_ahead`` view from
Chapter 3. (If you're following along with code, we'll leave it up to you to
change ``hours_ahead`` to use the template system.) Here's what that would
look like::

    {% extends "base.html" %}

    {% block title %}Future time{% endblock %}

    {% block content %}
    <p>In {{ hour_offset }} hour(s), it will be {{ next_time }}.</p>
    {% endblock %}

Isn't this beautiful? Each template contains only the code that's *unique* to
that template. No redundancy needed. If you need to make a sitewide design
change, just make the change to ``base.html``, and all of the other templates
will immediately reflect the change.

Here's how it works:

    * When you load the template ``current_datetime.html``, the template engine
      sees the ``{% extends %}`` tag, noting that this template is a child
      template. The engine immediately loads the parent template -- in this
      case, ``base.html``.

    * At that point, the template engine notices the three ``{% block %}`` tags
      in ``base.html`` and replaces those blocks with the contents of the child
      template. So, the title we've defined in ``{% block title %}`` will be
      used, as will the ``{% block content %}``.

      Note that since the child template doesn't define the ``footer`` block,
      the template system uses the value from the parent template instead.
      Content within a ``{% block %}`` tag in a parent template is always used
      as a fallback.

Inheritance doesn't affect the way the context works, and you can use
as many levels of inheritance as needed. One common way of using inheritance
is the following three-level approach:

    * Create a ``base.html`` template that holds the main look-and-feel of
      your site. This is the stuff that rarely, if ever, changes.

    * Create a ``base_SECTION.html`` template for each "section" of your site.
      For example, ``base_photos.html``, ``base_forum.html``. These templates
      all extend ``base.html`` and include section-specific styles/design.

    * Create individual templates for each type of page, such as a forum page
      or a photo gallery. These templates extend the appropriate section
      template.

This approach maximizes code reuse and makes it easy to add items to shared
areas, such as section-wide navigation.


Here are some tips for working with template inheritance:

    * If you use ``{% extends %}`` in a template, it must be the first
      template tag in that template. Otherwise, template inheritance won't
      work.

    * Generally, the more ``{% block %}`` tags in your base templates, the
      better. Remember, child templates don't have to define all parent blocks,
      so you can fill in reasonable defaults in a number of blocks, then only
      define the ones you need in the child templates. It's better to have more
      hooks than fewer hooks.

    * If you find yourself duplicating code in a number of templates, it
      probably means you should move that code to a ``{% block %}`` in a
      parent template.

    * If you need to get the content of the block from the parent template,
      the ``{{ block.super }}`` variable will do the trick. This is useful if
      you want to add to the contents of a parent block instead of completely
      overriding it.

    * You may not define multiple ``{% block %}`` tags with the same name in
      the same template. This limitation exists because a block tag works in
      "both" directions. That is, a block tag doesn't just provide a hole to
      fill -- it also defines the content that fills the hole in the *parent*.
      If there were two similarly-named ``{% block %}`` tags in a template,
      that template's parent wouldn't know which one of the blocks' content to
      use.

    * The template name you pass to ``{% extends %}`` is loaded using the same
      method that ``get_template()`` uses. That is, the template name is
      appended to your ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` setting.

    * In most cases, the argument to ``{% extends %}`` will be a string, but it
      can also be a variable, if you don't know the name of the parent template
      until runtime. This lets you do some cool, dynamic stuff.

Exercises
=========

Here are a few exercises that will solidify some of the things you learned in
this chapter. (Hint: Even if you think you understood everything, at least
give these exercises, and their respective answers, a read. We introduce a
couple of new tricks here.)

    1. You've got a list of musicians and the genre of music each one plays.
       This data is stored as a list of dictionaries, which will be hard-coded
       in your view module. (Usually we'd use a database for this, but we
       haven't yet covered Django's database layer.) The list looks like this::

           MUSICIANS = [
               {'name': 'Django Reinhardt', 'genre': 'jazz'},
               {'name': 'Jimi Hendrix',     'genre': 'rock'},
               {'name': 'Louis Armstrong',  'genre': 'jazz'},
               {'name': 'Pete Townsend',    'genre': 'rock'},
               {'name': 'Yanni',            'genre': 'new age'},
               {'name': 'Ella Fitzgerald',  'genre': 'jazz'},
               {'name': 'Wesley Willis',    'genre': 'casio'},
               {'name': 'John Lennon',      'genre': 'rock'},
               {'name': 'Bono',             'genre': 'rock'},
               {'name': 'Garth Brooks',     'genre': 'country'},
               {'name': 'Duke Ellington',   'genre': 'jazz'},
               {'name': 'William Shatner',  'genre': 'spoken word'},
               {'name': 'Madonna',          'genre': 'pop'},
           ]

       Write a Django view and corresponding template(s) that display an HTML
       ``<table>`` with a row for each musician in this list, in order. Each
       row should have two columns: the musician's name and the type of music
       he/she plays.

    2. Once you've done that: For all the musicians who play jazz or rock
       -- but *not* the others -- indicate their importance by applying a
       ``style="font-weight: bold;"`` to the ``<td>`` cells for their names.

    3. Once you've done that: For all the musicians who have a one-word name --
       but *not* the others -- display an asterisk after their name. Add a
       footnote to the page that says "* Pretentious." Maintain the
       ``style="font-weight bold;"`` from the previous exercise.

    4. Given the following three templates, devise a template-inheritance scheme
       that removes as much redundancy as possible.

       Template 1::

           <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
           <html lang="en">
           <head>
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" type="text/css">
               <title>My to-do list</title>
           </head>
           <body>
               <h1 id="top">Latest tasks</h1>
               {% if task_list %}
                   <ul>
                   {% for task in task_list %}<li>{{ task }}</li>{% endfor %}
                   </ul>
               {% else %}
                   <p>You have no tasks.</p>
               {% endif %}
               <hr>
               <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>.</p>
           </body>
           </html>

       Template 2::

           <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
           <html lang="en">
           <head>
               <title>Task: {{ task.title }} | To-do list</title>
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" type="text/css">
           </head>
           <body>
               <h1 id="top">{{ task.title }}</h1>
               <p>{{ task.description }}</p>
               <hr>
               <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>.</p>
           </body>
           </html>

       Template 3::

           <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
           <html lang="en">
           <head>
               <title>Completed tasks | To-do list</title>
               <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" type="text/css">
               <script type="text/javascript" src="completed.js">
           </head>
           <body>
               <h1 id="top">{{ task.title }}</h1>
               <p>{{ task.description }}</p>
               <hr>
               <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>.</p>
           </body>
           </html>

Answers to exercises
====================

    1. Here's one possible implementation of the view::

           from django.shortcuts import render_to_response

           MUSICIANS = [
               # ...
           ]

           def musician_list(request):
               return render_to_response('musician_list.html', {'musicians': MUSICIANS})

       And here's the template::

           <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
           <html lang="en">
           <head>
               <title>Musician list</title>
           </head>
           <body>
               <table>
               <tr><th>Musician</th><th>Genre</th></tr>
               {% for musician in musicians %}
                   <tr>
                   <td>{{ musician.name }}</td>
                   <td>{{ musician.genre }}</td>
                   </tr>
               {% endfor %}
               </table>
           </body>
           </html>

    2. A rather clumsy way to do this would be to use ``{% ifequal %}`` in the
       template. The view would stay the same as in the answer to the last
       exercise, and the template's ``{% for %}`` loop would change to
       something like this::

           {% for musician in musicians %}
               <tr>
               <td {% ifequal musician.genre 'jazz' %}style="font-weight: bold;"{% endifequal %}
                   {% ifequal musician.genre 'rock' %}style="font-weight: bold;"{% endifequal %}>
                 {{ musician.name }}
               </td>
               <td>{{ musician.genre }}</td>
               </tr>
           {% endfor %}

       This is overly verbose, repetitive and error-prone -- and it illustrates
       an important point. A key to mastering Django's template system is to
       know *what to pass* to the template. Because templates do not have the
       full programming-language power of an environment you might be used to,
       it's more important in a Django environment to do as much *business logic*
       (as opposed to *presentation logic*) as possible in your view.

       In this case, a cleaner way of solving the problem would be to have the
       view precalculate whether a musician is important. After all, this
       is business logic, not presentation logic. The presentation
       logic dictates *how* the special-case genres should be
       displayed, not *which* musicians are special-cased. This is an
       important distinction.

       Here's one way to code the view::

           def musician_list(request):
               musicians = []
               for m in MUSICIANS:
                   musicians.append({
                       'name': m['name'],
                       'genre': m['genre'],
                       'is_important': m['genre'] in ('rock', 'jazz'),
                   })
               return render_to_response('musician_list.html', {'musicians': musicians})

       And with that view, you could use this template code::

           {% for musician in musicians %}
               <tr>
               <td{% if musician.is_important %} style="font-weight: bold;"{% endif %}>
                 {{ musician.name }}
               </td>
               <td>{{ musician.genre }}</td>
               </tr>
           {% endfor %}

       See how much cleaner that is in the template? Even this is more complex
       than it usually will be, because usually you'll be dealing with database
       objects, and database objects can have custom methods (such as
       ``is_important()``). We'll cover database objects in the next chapter.

    3. This is a similar problem to the previous exercise, and the solution is
       also similar. The key is to precalculate whether a musician deserves an
       asterisk next to his or her name. Because that's business logic, it
       belongs in the view.

       Here's one possible view implementation::

           def musician_list(request):
               musicians = []
               for m in MUSICIANS:
                   musicians.append({
                       'name': m['name'],
                       'genre': m['genre'],
                       'is_important': m['genre'] in ('rock', 'jazz'),
                       'is_pretentious': ' ' not in m['name'],
                   })
               return render_to_response('musician_list.html', {'musicians': musicians})

       We're using the expression ``' ' not in m['name']``, which returns
       ``True`` if ``m['name']`` doesn't include a space. You could also use the
       ``.find()`` method, like this::

           'is_pretentious': m['name'].find(' ') == -1

       Note that we're calling this variable ``is_pretentious`` rather than
       ``has_asterisk``, because the fact that we're using asterisks is a
       presentation decision.

       With the above view, you could use this template code::

           {% for musician in musicians %}
               <tr>
               <td{% if musician.is_important %} style="font-weight: bold;"{% endif %}>
                 {% if musician.is_pretentious %}* {% endif %}{{ musician.name }}
               </td>
               <td>{{ musician.genre }}</td>
               </tr>
           {% endfor %}

       Don't forget the "* Pretentious." at the bottom of the template.

       For bonus points, be a perfectionist and only display the
       "* Pretentious" footnote if there's at least one pretentious musician.
       Determine the presence of a pretentious musician in the view, like so::

           def musician_list(request):
               musicians = []
               has_pretentious = False
               for m in MUSICIANS:
                   if ' ' not in m['name']:
                       has_pretentious = True
                   musicians.append({
                       'name': m['name'],
                       'genre': m['genre'],
                       'is_important': m['genre'] in ('rock', 'jazz'),
                       'is_pretentious': ' ' not in m['name'],
                   })
               return render_to_response('musician_list.html', {
                   'musicians': musicians,
                   'has_pretentious': has_pretentious,
               })

       In this implementation, we pass an extra template variable,
       ``has_pretentious``, to the template. Then use it in the template like
       so::

           {% if has_pretentious %}* Pretentious{% endif %}

    4. Here's one way to write the base template::

           <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
               <html lang="en">
               <head>
                   <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" type="text/css">
                   <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
                   {% block extrahead %}{% endblock %}
               </head>
               <body>
                   <h1 id="top">{% block headline %}{% endblock %}</h1>
                   {% block content %}{% endblock %}
                   <hr>
                   <p><a href="#top">Back to top</a>.</p>
               </body>
               </html>

       And, with that base template, here's how the child templates might look.

       Template 1::

           {% extends "base.html" %}

           {% block title %}My to-do list{% endblock %}

           {% block headline %}Latest tasks{% endblock %}

           {% block content %}
           {% if task_list %}
               <ul>
               {% for task in task_list %}<li>{{ task }}</li>{% endfor %}
               </ul>
           {% else %}
               <p>You have no tasks.</p>
           {% endif %}
           {% endblock %}

       Template 2::

           {% extends "base.html" %}

           {% block title %}Task: {{ task.title }} | To-do list{% endblock %}

           {% block headline %}{{ task.title }}{% endblock %}

           {% block content %}<p>{{ task.description }}</p>{% endblock %}

       Template 3::

           {% extends "base.html" %}

           {% block title %}Completed tasks | To-do list{% endblock %}

           {% block extrahead %}<script type="text/javascript" src="completed.js">{% endblock %}

           {% block headline %}{{ task.title }}{% endblock %}

           {% block content %}<p>{{ task.description }}</p>{% endblock %}

       Note that we like to put an empty line of space between ``{% block %}``
       sections, but that's just our personal style. Any text outside of
       ``{% block %}`` tags in child templates will not be rendered.
