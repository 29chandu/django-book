Chapter 11: Generating non-HTML content
=======================================

The vast majority of content on the Web is some flavor of HTML (XXX% according
to a study by Google). Thus, Django is logically optimized towards producing
HTML content; most defaults, and shortcuts like ``render_to_response``, expect
that you're producing HTML in your views.

There are, of course, times when you're going to want to produce something other
than HTML, and luckily Django makes that super-easy, too.  

The basics
==========

- HttpResponse (and subclasses)
- HttpResponse is a file-like-object
- the mimetype argument to HttpResponse

Django handles some of the common types for you...
