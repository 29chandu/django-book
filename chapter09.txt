========================
Chapter 9: Generic views
========================

.. contents::

Here again is a recurring theme of this book: at it worst web development is
boring and monotonous. So far you've seen how Django tries to take away some
of that monotony at the model and template layers, but web developers also
experience this boredom at the view level.

Django's **generic views** were to developed to ease that pain. They take
certain common idioms and patterns in view development and abstract them so
that you can quickly write common views of onto data without having to write
too much code.

In fact, nearly every example in the preceding chapters could be re-written
with the help of generic views.

Django contains generic views to do the following:

    * Perform common "simple" tasks: redirect to a different page, and
      render a given template.

    * Display list and detail pages for a single object. For example, the
      Django documentation index
      (http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/) and individual
      document pages are built this way. The crime index and list of
      crimes by type views from Chapter 5 could easily be re-written to
      use generic views; we'll do so below.

    * Present date-based objects in year/month/day archive pages,
      associated detail and "latest" pages.  The Django weblog's
      (http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/) year, month, and
      day archives are built with these, as are ljworld.com's
      news archives, and a whole host of others.

    * Allow users to create, update, and delete objects -- with or
      without authorization.  We'll show how to replace the views
      from Chapter 7 with these views below.

Taken together, these views provide easy interfaces to perform the most common
tasks we encounter.

Using generic views
===================

All of these views are used by creating configuration dictionaries in
your URLconf files and passing those dictionaries as the third member of the
URLconf tuple for a given pattern.

For example, here's the URLconf for the simple weblog app that drives the blog
on djangoproject.com::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from django_website.apps.blog.models import Entry

    info_dict = {
        'queryset': Entry.objects.all(),
        'date_field': 'pub_date',
    }

    urlpatterns = patterns('django.views.generic.date_based',
       (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/(?P<day>\w{1,2})/(?P<slug>[-\w]+)/$', 'object_detail', dict(info_dict, slug_field='slug')),
       (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/(?P<day>\w{1,2})/$',                  'archive_day',   info_dict),
       (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/$',                                   'archive_month', info_dict),
       (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/$',                                                       'archive_year',  info_dict),
       (r'^/?$',                                                                     'archive_index', info_dict),
    )

As you can see, this URLconf defines a few options in ``info_dict``.
``'queryset'`` gives the generic view a ``QuerySet`` of objects to use (in
this case, all of the ``Entry`` objects) and tells the generic view which
model is being used.  The remaining arguments to each generic view are taken
from the named captures in the URLconf.

This is really all the "view" code for Django's weblog!  The only thing that's left
is writing a template.

Documentation of each generic view follows, along with a list of all keyword
arguments that a generic view expects. Remember that as in the example above,
arguments may either come from the URL pattern (as ``month``, ``day``,
``year``, etc. do above) or from the additional-information dictionary (as for
``queryset``, ``date_field``, etc.).

Most generic views require the ``queryset`` key, which is a ``QuerySet``
instance; see the database API referenecce in Chapter XXX for more information
about ``QuerySet`` objects.

Most views also take an optional ``extra_context`` dictionary that you can use
to pass any auxiliary information you wish to the view. The values in the
``extra_context`` dictionary can be either functions (or other callables) or
other objects. Functions are evaluated just before they are passed to the
template.

"Simple" generic views
======================

The ``django.views.generic.simple`` module contains simple views to handle a
couple of common cases: rendering a template when no view logic is needed,
and issuing a redirect.

Rendering a template
--------------------

The function ``django.views.generic.simple.direct_to_template`` renders a
given template, passing it a ``{{ params }}`` template variable, which is a
dictionary of the parameters captured in the URL.

Example
```````

Given the following URL patterns::

    urlpatterns = patterns('django.views.generic.simple',
        (r'^foo/$',             'direct_to_template', {'template': 'foo_index.html'}),
        (r'^foo/(?P<id>\d+)/$', 'direct_to_template', {'template': 'foo_detail.html'}),
    )

a request to ``/foo/`` would render the template ``foo_index.html``, and a
request to ``/foo/15/`` would render the ``foo_detail.html`` with a context
variable ``{{ params.id }}`` that is set to ``15``.

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``template``
        The full name of a template to use.

Redirecting to another URL
--------------------------

``django.views.generic.simple.redirect_to`` redirects to another URL.
The given URL may contain dictionary-style string formatting, which will be
interpolated against the parameters captured in the URL.

If the given URL is ``None``, Django will return an HTTP 410 (Gone) message.

Example
```````

This example redirects from ``/foo/<id>/`` to ``/bar/<id>/``::

    urlpatterns = patterns('django.views.generic.simple',
        ('^foo/(?p<id>\d+)/$', 'redirect_to', {'url': '/bar/%(id)s/'}),
    )

This example returns a 410 HTTP error for requests to ``/bar/``::

    urlpatterns = patterns('django.views.generic.simple',
        ('^bar/$', 'redirect_to', {'url': None}),
    )

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``url``:
        The URL to redirect to, as a string. Or ``None`` to return a 410 ("gone")
        HTTP response.
        
More complex generic views
==========================

Although the simple generic views certainly are useful, the real power in
Django's generic views comes from the more complex views that allow you to
build common CRUD (Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete) pages with a minimum amount
of code.

These views break down into a few different types:

    * List/detail views, which provide flat lists of objects and individual
      object detail pages (for example, a list of places and individual
      place information pages).
      
    * Date-based views, which provide year/month/day drill-down pages of
      date-centric information.
      
    * Create/update/delete views, which allow you to quickly create views
      to create, modify, or delete objects.
      
Common optional arguments
-------------------------

Most of these views take a large number of optional arguments that can control
various bits of behavior.  Many of these arguments may be given to any of
these views, so many of the views below refer back to this list of optional arguments:

    ``allow_empty``
        A boolean specifying whether to display the page if no objects are
        available. If this is ``False`` and no objects are available, the view
        will raise a 404 instead of displaying an empty page. By default, this
        is ``False``.

    ``context_processors``
        A list of template-context processors to apply to the view's template.
        See Chapter XXX for information on template context processors.

    ``extra_context``
        A dictionary of values to add to the template context. By default,
        this is an empty dictionary. If a value in the dictionary is callable,
        the generic view will call it just before rendering the template.

    ``mimetype``
        The MIME type to use for the resulting document. Defaults to the value
        of the ``DEFAULT_MIME_TYPE`` setting.
        
    ``template_loader``
        The template loader to use when loading the template. By default, it's
        ``django.template.loader``.  See Chapter XXX for information on
        template loaders.

    ``template_name``
        The full name of a template to use in rendering the page. This lets
        you override the default template name derived from the ``QuerySet``.

    ``template_object_name``
        Designates the name of the template variable to use in the template
        context. By default, this is ``'object'``. Views list list more than
        one objec will append ``'_list'`` to the value of this parameter.
    
List/detail generic views
=========================

The list-detail generic views (in the module
``django.views.generic.list_detail``) handles the common case of displaying a
list of items at one view, and individual "detail" views of those items at
another.

For the examples in the rest of this chapter, we'll be working with the simple
book/author/publisher objects from chapters 5 and 6::

    class Publisher(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(maxlength=30)
        address = models.CharField(maxlength=50)
        city = models.CharField(maxlength=60)
        state_province = models.CharField(maxlength=30)
        country = models.CharField(maxlength=50)
        website = models.URLField()

    class Author(models.Model):
        salutation = models.CharField(maxlength=10)
        first_name = models.CharField(maxlength=30)
        last_name = models.CharField(maxlength=40)
        email = models.EmailField()
        headshot = models.ImageField()

    class Book(models.ModelField):
        title = models.CharField(maxlength=100)
        authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
        publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher)
        publication_date = models.DateField()

We'll also be working with a URL module; if you're following along, you can start
with an skeleton URL config in ``bookstore.urls``::

    from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
    from django.views.generic import list_detail, date_based
    from bookstore.models import Publisher, Author, Book
    
    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        # We'll add URL patterns here.
    )

We'll build this up with generic views as we go.

Lists of objects
----------------

The view ``django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list`` is used to create a
page representing a list of objects.


Example
```````

We can use the ``object_list`` view to show a simple list of all authors in the
bookstore. First, we'll need to construct a info dictionary for the generic view.
Add the following to the top of the ``bookstore/urls.py`` file::

    author_list_info = {
        'queryset' :   Author.objects.all(),
        'allow_empty': True,
    }

Then, we need to register this view at a certain URL. We can do that by adding
this URL config piece (inside the ``patterns`` directive)::

    (r'authors/$', list_detail.object_list, author_list_info)

From there, we just need to make a template for this generic view to render.
Since we didn't provide the ``template_name`` parameter (see below), Django
will guess the name of the template; here it'll use ``bookstore/author_list.html``.
See below for more details on how this "guess" is made.

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` of objects to list

Optional arguments
``````````````````

    ``paginate_by``
        An integer specifying how many objects should be displayed per page.
        If this is given, the view will paginate objects with ``paginate_by``
        objects per page. The view will expect either a ``page`` query string
        parameter (via ``GET``) containing a zero-indexed page number, or a
        ``page`` variable specified in the URLconf. See "Notes on pagination"
        below.

Additionally, this view may take any of these common arguments described above:

    * ``allow_empty``
    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
    * ``template_object_name``

Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_list.html`` by default. Both the app label and the
model name are derived from the ``queryset`` parameter: the app label is the
name of the app that the model is defined in, and the model name is the
lower-cased version of the name of the model class.

So, if we passed ``Author.objects.all()`` as the ``queryset``, the app label
would be ``bookstore`` and the model name would be ``author``. This means the
default template would be ``bookstore/author_list.html``.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will contain:

    ``object_list``
        The list of objects. This variable's name depends on the
        ``template_object_name`` parameter, which is ``'object'`` by default.
        If ``template_object_name`` is ``'foo'``, this variable's name will be
        ``foo_list``.

    ``is_paginated``
        A boolean representing whether the results are paginated.
        Specifically, this is set to ``False`` if the number of available
        objects is less than or equal to ``paginate_by``.

If the results are paginated, the context will contain these extra variables:

    ``results_per_page``
        The number of objects per page. (Same as the ``paginate_by``
        parameter.)

    ``has_next``
        A boolean representing whether there's a next page.

    ``has_previous``
        A boolean representing whether there's a previous page.

    ``page``
        The current page number, as an integer. This is 1-based.

    ``next``
        The next page number, as an integer. If there's no next page, this
        will still be an integer representing the theoretical next-page
        number. This is 1-based.

    ``previous``
        The previous page number, as an integer. This is 1-based.

    ``pages``
        The total number of pages, as an integer.

    ``hits``
        The total number of objects across *all* pages, not just this page.

.. admonition:: A note on pagination:

    If ``paginate_by`` is specified, Django will paginate the results. You can
    specify the page number in the URL in one of two ways:

        * Use the ``page`` parameter in the URLconf. For example, this is what
          your URLconf might look like::

            (r'^objects/page(?P<page>[0-9]+)/$', 'object_list', dict(info_dict))

        * Pass the page number via the ``page`` query-string parameter. For
          example, a URL would look like this:

            /objects/?page=3

    In both cases, ``page`` is 1-based, not 0-based, so the first page would be
    represented as page ``1``.
    

Detail views
------------

The ``django.views.generic.list_detail.object_detail`` gives a "detail" view
of a single object.

Example
```````

Extending the example above, we could make a detail view for a given author.
Given an info dict like this::

    author_detail_info = {
        "queryset" : Author.objects.all(),
        "template_object_name" : "author",
    }

We could use a urlpattern like::

    (r'^authors/(?P<object_id>\d+)/$', list_detail.object_detail, author_detail_info),

to show details about a given book, rendered in the
``bookstore/author_detail.html`` template. In that template, the ``Author``
object itself would be put into the ``{{ author }}`` variable.

Required arguments
``````````````````

    `queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` that will be searched for the object.

Either:

    ``object_id``
        The value of the primary-key field for the object.

or:

    ``slug``
        The slug of the given object.  If you pass this field, then
        the ``slug_field`` argument (below) is also required.

Optional arguments
``````````````````

    ``slug_field``
        The name of the field on the object containing the slug.  This is
        required if you are using the ``slug`` argument, but must be absent
        if you're using the ``object_id`` argument.

    ``template_name_field``
        The name of a field on the object whose value is the template name to
        use. This lets you store template names in your data.

        In other words, if your object has a field ``'the_template'`` that
        contains a string ``'foo.html'``, and you set ``template_name_field``
        to ``'the_template'``, then the generic view for this object will use
        the template ``'foo.html'``.

        It's a bit of a brain-bender, but it's useful in some cases.

This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
    * ``template_object_name``

Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` and ``template_name_field`` aren't specified, this view
will use the template ``<app_label>/<model_name>_detail.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``object``
        The object. This variable's name depends on the
        ``template_object_name`` parameter, which is ``'object'`` by default.
        If ``template_object_name`` is ``'foo'``, this variable's name will be
        ``foo``.

Date-based generic views
========================

Date-based generic views are generally used to provide a set of "archive"
pages for dated material. Think year/month/day archives for a newspaper, or a
blog like the official Django blog described at the beginning of this chapter.

For the examples, we'll be using the ``Book`` object from above, and build up
a way to browse books by year, month, and day published.
Notice that for each of these views, we have to tell Django the name of the
date field we want to key off of. We have to provide this information since
models could contain multiple date or datetime fields.

.. admonition:: Into the future...

    By default, these views ignore objects with dates in the future.  
    
    This means that if you try to visit an archive page in the future, Django
    will automatically show a 404 ("not found") error, even if there are
    objects published that day.
    
    Thus, you can publish post-dated objects that don't appear publically
    until after their publication date.
        
    However, for different types of date-based objects this isn't appropriate
    (for example, a calendar of upcoming events). For these views, setting the
    ``allow_future`` option to ``True`` will make the future objects appear
    (and allow users to visit "future" archive pages).

Archive index
-------------

The ``django.views.generic.date_based.archive_index`` view provides a
top-level index page showing the "latest" objects, by date.

Example
```````

A typical publisher probably wants to highlight recently-published books.
We can use the ``archive_index`` view for this common task.  Here's a info dict::

    book_info = {
        "queryset"   : Book.objects.all(),
        "date_field" : "publication_date"
    }
    
And the corresponding urlconf piece (which roots this index at the bottom level
of wherever it's included)::

    (r'^books/$', date_based.archive_index, book_info),

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``date_field``: 
        The name of the ``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` in the
        ``QuerySet``'s model that the date-based archive should use to
        determine the objects on the page.

    ``queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` of objects for which the archive serves.

Optional arguments
``````````````````
    
    ``allow_future``
        A boolean specifying whether to include "future" objects on this page,
        as described in the note above.

    ``num_latest``
        The number of latest objects to send to the template context. By
        default, it's 15.

This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``allow_empty``
    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
        
Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_archive.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``date_list``
        A list of ``datetime.date`` objects representing all years that have
        objects available according to ``queryset``. These are ordered in
        reverse. 
        
        For example, if you have blog entries from 2003 through 2006, this
        list will contain four ``datetime.date`` objects: one for each of
        those years.
      
    ``latest``
        The ``num_latest`` objects in the system, ordered descending by
        ``date_field``. For example, if ``num_latest`` is ``10``, then
        ``latest`` will be a list of the latest 10 objects in ``queryset``.

Year archives
-------------

The ``django.views.generic.date_based.archive_year`` view provides a yearly
archive page showing all available months in a given year.

Example
```````

Contuting on with our example, we'll want to add a way to view all the books
published in a given year.  We can keep using the ``book_info`` dictionary
from the above example, but this time we'll wire it up to the ``archive_year``
view::

    (r'^books/(?P<year>\d{4})/?$', date_based.archive_year, book_info),

Since there are likely many, many books published each year, we won't
display them on this page, just a list of years in which books are
available.  Conveniently for us, this is what Django does by default; to
change it we could use the ``make_object_list`` argument; see below.

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``date_field``
        As above.

    ``queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` of objects for which the archive serves.

    ``year``
        The four-digit year for which the archive serves (usually taken
        from URL parameters).
   
Optional arguments
``````````````````

    ``make_object_list``
        A boolean specifying whether to retrieve the full list of objects for
        this year and pass those to the template. If ``True``, this list of
        objects will be made available to the template as ``object_list``.
        (The name ``object_list`` may be different; see the information about
        ``object_list`` in the "Template context" section below.) By default,
        this is ``False``.
    
    ``allow_future``
        A boolean specifying whether to include "future" objects on this page,
        as described in the note above.
        
This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``allow_empty``
    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
    * ``template_object_name``

Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_archive_year.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``date_list``
        A list of ``datetime.date`` objects representing all months that have
        objects available in the given year, according to ``queryset``, in
        ascending order.
    
    ``year``
        The given year, as a four-character string.
    
    ``object_list``
        If the ``make_object_list`` parameter is ``True``, this will be set to
        a list of objects available for the given year, ordered by the date
        field. This variable's name depends on the ``template_object_name``
        parameter, which is ``'object'`` by default. If
        ``template_object_name`` is ``'foo'``, this variable's name will be
        ``foo_list``.
        
        If ``make_object_list`` is ``False``, ``object_list`` will be passed
        to the template as an empty list.

Monthly archives
----------------

The ``django.views.generic.date_based.archive_month`` views provides a monthly
archive page showing all objects in a given month.

Example
```````

Continuing on with our example, creating month views should look mighty familiar::

    (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/$', date_based.archive_month, book_info),


Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``year``
        The four-digit year for which the archive serves (a string).
    
    ``month``
        The month for which the archive serves, formatted according to the
        ``month_format`` argument.
    
    ``queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` of objects for which the archive serves.
    
    ``date_field``
        The name of the ``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` in the
        ``QuerySet``'s model that the date-based archive should use to
        determine the objects on the page.

Optional arguments
``````````````````

    ``month_format``
        A format string that regulates what format the ``month`` parameter
        uses. This should be in the syntax accepted by Python's
        ``time.strftime``. (See Python's strftime docs at
        http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-time.html#l2h-1941) It's
        set to ``"%b"`` by default, which is a three-letter month abbreviation
        (i.e. "jan", "feb", etc.). To change it to use numbers, use ``"%m"``.
    
    ``allow_future`` 
        A boolean specifying whether to include "future" objects on this page,
        as described in the note above.
        
This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``allow_empty``
    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
    * ``template_object_name``
    
Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_archive_month.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``month``
        A ``datetime.date`` object representing the given month.
    
    ``next_month``
        A ``datetime.date`` object representing the first day of the next
        month. If the next month is in the future, this will be ``None``.
    
    ``previous_month``
        A ``datetime.date`` object representing the first day of the previous
        month. Unlike ``next_month``, this will never be ``None``.
    
    ``object_list``
        A list of objects available for the given month. This variable's name
        depends on the ``template_object_name`` parameter, which is
        ``'object'`` by default. If ``template_object_name`` is ``'foo'``,
        this variable's name will be ``foo_list``.

Week archives
-------------

The ``django.views.generic.date_based.archive_week`` view shows all objects in
a given week.

.. note::

    Django believes that weeks start on Sunday, for the perfectly arbitrary
    reason that Python does, too.
    

Example
```````

Are you starting to see a pattern here yet?

::

    (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<week>\d{2})/$', date_based.archive_week, book_info),

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``year``
        The four-digit year for which the archive serves (a string).
    
    ``week``
        The week of the year for which the archive serves (a string).
    
    ``queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` of objects for which the archive serves.
    
    ``date_field``
        The name of the ``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` in the
        ``QuerySet``'s model that the date-based archive should use to
        determine the objects on the page.

Optional arguments

    ``allow_future`` 
        A boolean specifying whether to include "future" objects on this page,
        as described in the note above.
        
This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
    * ``template_object_name``

Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_archive_week.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``week``
        A ``datetime.date`` object representing the first day of the given
        week.
    
    ``object_list``
        A list of objects available for the given week. This variable's name
        depends on the ``template_object_name`` parameter, which is
        ``'object'`` by default. If ``template_object_name`` is ``'foo'``,
        this variable's name will be ``foo_list``.

Day archives
------------

The ``django.views.generic.date_based.archive_day`` view provides a page
showing all objects in a given day.

Example
```````

Keep on keepin' on::

    (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/(?P<day>\d{2})/$', date_based.archive_day, book_info),

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``year``
        The four-digit year for which the archive serves (a string).
    
    ``month``
        The month for which the archive serves, formatted according to the
        ``month_format`` argument.
    
    ``day``
        The day for which the archive serves, formatted according to the
        ``day_format`` argument.
    
    ``queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` of objects for which the archive serves.
    
    ``date_field``
        The name of the ``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` in the
        ``QuerySet``'s model that the date-based archive should use to
        determine the objects on the page.

Optional arguments
``````````````````

    ``month_format``
        A format string that regulates what format the ``month`` parameter
        uses. See the detailed explanation above.

    ``day_format``
        Like ``month_format``, but for the ``day`` parameter. It defaults to
        ``"%d"`` (day of the month as a decimal number, 01-31).

    ``allow_future`` 
        A boolean specifying whether to include "future" objects on this page,
        as described in the note above.

This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``allow_empty``
    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
    * ``template_object_name``

Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_archive_day.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``day``
        A ``datetime.date`` object representing the given day.
    
    ``next_day``
        A ``datetime.date`` object representing the next day. If the next day
        is in the future, this will be ``None``.
    
    ``previous_day``
        A ``datetime.date`` object representing the given day. Unlike
        ``next_day``, this will never be ``None``.
    
    ``object_list``
        A list of objects available for the given day. This variable's name
        depends on the ``template_object_name`` parameter, which is
        ``'object'`` by default. If ``template_object_name`` is ``'foo'``,
        this variable's name will be ``foo_list``.

Archive for today
-----------------

The ``django.views.generic.date_based.archive_today`` view shows all objects
for *today*. This is exactly the same as ``archive_day``, except the
``year``/``month``/``day`` arguments are not used, and today's date is used
instead.

Date-based detail pages
-----------------------

The ``django.views.generic.date_based.object_detail`` view shows a page
representing an individual object. This differs from the ``object_detail``
page in their respective URLs; the ``object_detail`` view uses URLs like
``/entries/<slug>/``, while this one uses URLs like
``/entries/2006/aug/27/<slug>/``.

.. note::

    If you're using date-based detail pages with slugs in the URLs, you
    probably also want to use the ``unique_for_date`` option on the slug field
    to validate that slugs aren't duplicated in a single day. See Chapter XXX
    for details on ``unique_for_date``.
    
Example
```````

This one differs (slightly) from all the other examples in that we need to
either provide an object ID or a slug so that Django can look up the object
in question.  

Since the object we're using doesn't have a slug field, we'll use the slightly
uglyier ID-based URLs.  In practice we'd prefer to use a slug field, but
in the interest of simplicity we'll let it go.

We'll add the following to the URLconf::

    (r'^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/(?P<day>\d{2})/(?P<object_id>[\w-]+)/$', date_based.object_detail, book_info),

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``year``
        The object's four-digit year (a string).
    
    ``month``
        The object's month , formatted according to the ``month_format``
        argument.
    
    ``day``
        The object's day , formatted according to the ``day_format`` argument.
    
    ``queryset``
        A ``QuerySet`` that contains the object.
    
    ``date_field``
        The name of the ``DateField`` or ``DateTimeField`` in the
        ``QuerySet``'s model that the generic view should use to look up the
        object according to ``year``, ``month`` and ``day``.

Either:

    ``object_id``
        The value of the primary-key field for the object.

or:

    ``slug``
        The slug of the given object.  If you pass this field, then
        the ``slug_field`` argument (below) is also required.

Optional arguments
``````````````````

    ``allow_future`` 
        A boolean specifying whether to include "future" objects on this page,
        as described in the note above.

    ``day_format``
        Like ``month_format``, but for the ``day`` parameter. It defaults to
        ``"%d"`` (day of the month as a decimal number, 01-31).

    ``month_format``
        A format string that regulates what format the
      ``month`` parameter uses.  See the detailed explanation above.

    ``slug_field``
        The name of the field on the object containing the slug. This is
        required if you are using the ``slug`` argument, but must be absent if
        you're using the ``object_id`` argument.
          
    ``template_name_field``
        The name of a field on the object whose value is the template name to
        use. This lets you store template names in the data. In other words,
        if your object has a field ``'the_template'`` that contains a string
        ``'foo.html'``, and you set ``template_name_field`` to
        ``'the_template'``, then the generic view for this object will use the
        template ``'foo.html'``.
        
        It's a bit of a brain-bender, but it's useful in some cases.

This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``mimetype``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``
    * ``template_object_name``

Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_detail.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``object``
        The object. This variable's name depends on the
        ``template_object_name`` parameter, which is ``'object'`` by default.
        If ``template_object_name`` is ``'foo'``, this variable's name will be
        ``foo``.

Create/update/delete generic views
==================================

The ``django.views.generic.create_update`` module contains a set of functions
for creating, editing and deleting objects.

Create object view
------------------

The ``django.views.generic.create_update.create_object`` view displays a form for
creating an object, redisplays the form with validation errors (if there are
any) and saves the object. This uses the automatic manipulators that come
with Django models.

Example
```````

XXX FIXME XXX

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``model``
        The Django model of the object that the form will create.

.. note::

    Notice that this view takes the *model* to be created, not a QuerySet
    (as all the views above do).

Optional arguments
``````````````````

    ``post_save_redirect``
        A URL to which the view will redirect after saving the object. By
        default, it's ``object.get_absolute_url()``.

    ``post_save_redirect``
        May contain dictionary string formatting, which will be interpolated
        against the object's field attributes. For example, you could use
        ``post_save_redirect="/polls/%(slug)s/"``.

    ``login_required``
        A boolean that designates whether a user must be logged in, in order
        to see the page and save changes. This hooks into the Django
        authentication system. By default, this is ``False``.

        If this is ``True``, and a non-logged-in user attempts to visit this
        page or save the form, Django will redirect the request to
        ``/accounts/login/``.

This view may also take these common arguments (documented above):

    * ``context_processors``
    * ``extra_context``
    * ``template_loader``
    * ``template_name``

Template name
`````````````

If ``template_name`` isn't specified, this view will use the template
``<app_label>/<model_name>_form.html`` by default.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``form``:
        A ``FormWrapper`` instance representing the form for editing the
        object. This lets you refer to form fields easily in the template
        system.

        For example, if the model has two fields, ``name`` and ``address``::

          <form action="" method="post">
          <p><label for="id_name">Name:</label> {{ form.name }}</p>
          <p><label for="id_address">Address:</label> {{ form.address }}</p>
          </form>

        See Chapter 7 for more information about working with forms.

Update object view
------------------

The ``django.views.generic.create_update.update_object`` view is almost
identical to the create-object view above, but this one allows the editing of
an existing object instead of the creation of a new one.

Example
```````

XXX FIXME XXX

Required arguments
``````````````````

    ``model``
        The Django model the form will be editing.
        
Either:

    ``object_id``
        The value of the primary-key field for the object.

or:

    ``slug``
        The slug of the given object.  If you pass this field, then
        the ``slug_field`` argument (below) is also required.

Optional arguments
``````````````````

``slug_field``
    The name of the field on the object containing the slug. This is
    required if you are using the ``slug`` argument, but must be absent if
    you're using the ``object_id`` argument.
    
Additionally, this view takes all same optional arguments as the creation view
(above), plus the ``template_object_name`` common argument.

Template name
`````````````

This view uses the same default template name
(``<app_label>/<model_name>_form.html``) as the creation view.

Template context
````````````````

In addition to ``extra_context``, the template's context will be:

    ``form``:
        A ``FormWrapper`` instance representing the form for editing the
        object. See the create object (above) for more about this value.

    ``object``:
        The original object being edited (this variable may be named
        differently if you've provided the ``template_object_name``
        argument).

Delete object view
------------------

The ``django.views.generic.create_update.delete_object`` view is also very
similar to the other two.

If this view is fetched with GET, it will display a confirmation page (i.e. 
"do you really want to delete this object?").  If the view is submitted 
with POST, the object will be deleted.

All the arguments are the same as for the update object view, as is the
context; the template name for this view is
``<app_label>/<model_name>_confirm_delete.html``
