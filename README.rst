Django Book Revival
===================

A revival of Django Book, the comprehensive guide to Django.

The goal is to overhaul this book with Django 1.4 compatibility and hopefully
keep it up to date with Django 1.5 and beyond!

*A current work in progress. If you'd like to help, please do. There's plenty of
work to be done!*

Current Status
--------------

The latest version is always available at ReadTheDocs: http://django-book.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Sept 2012, still groundwork organization being laid. Much of the book has not been vetted.

Development
-----------

Assuming you have Python installed, the only dependency is sphinx, available via pip:

 pip install sphinx

Build from the top directory:

 make build

And now the latest HTML documentation will be waiting in *en/_build/html/*

Contribute
----------

Want to contribute some changes?

Pull requests or discussion is pretty open right now, submit what you think
will help via GitHub.
