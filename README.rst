Django Book Revival
===================

A revival of Django Book, the comprehensive guide to Django.

I learned Django from this book originally and felt it was a great resource. Now
that Django has (finally) moved on, it would be great to bring the book back up
to date.

*A current work in progress. If you'd like to help, please do. There's plenty of
work to be done!*

Goals
-----

The goal is to overhaul this book with Django 1.4 compatibility and hopefully
keep it up to date with Django 1.5 and beyond!

- Update content and project idioms to be Django 1.4 compatible
- Remove deprecated Django 1.2 and 1.3 content/idioms
- Work toward a release that is peer reviewed before Django 1.5 launches
- Repeat for Django 1.5 and beyond!

Current Status
--------------

The latest version is always available at ReadTheDocs: http://django-book.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

See the project issues for more current status:

Sept 2012, still groundwork organization being laid. Much of the book has not been vetted.

Development
-----------

Assuming you have Python installed, the only dependency is sphinx, available via pip:

 pip install sphinx

Build from the top directory:

 make build

And now the latest HTML documentation will be waiting in *en/_build/html/*

Pull requests or discussion is pretty open right now, submit what you think
